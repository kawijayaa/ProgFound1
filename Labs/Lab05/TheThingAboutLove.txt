"The Thing About Love"

By Matt Terry

Found the letter that you wrote
Was in the pocket of my coat
Ain't it funny how, only thing that's left of you now
Said I was perfect then you walked
And I became an after-thought, 
Now I realize we never stood a chance
You know I waited for you, waited for you
Waited too long

That's the thing about love
The thing about love
Just when you think you're in control
It pulls you in and then it lets you go
That's the thing about love
The thing about love
You don't always get it back
So tell me how I'm gonna live like that

Doesn't matter what I do
All I think about is you, 
There's a hurricane every time I hear your name
Now I'm wide awake the whole night
Thinking what I didn't do right
Now I realize we never stood a chance

That's the thing about love
The thing about love
Just when you think you're in control
It pulls you in and then it lets you go
That's the thing about love
The thing about love
You don't always get it back
So tell me how I'm gonna live like that

Does it make you feel like, feel like it was worth it
'Cause it makes me feel like, feel like I don't deserve it
Yeah, I still mean it, feel it, and that's the thing about love
Love, love, love

Does it make you feel like, feel like it was worth it
'Cause it makes me feel like, feel like I don't deserve it
Yeah, I still mean it, feel it, and that's the thing about love
Love, love, love

That's the thing about love
The thing about love
You don't always get it back
So tell me how I'm gonna live like that
